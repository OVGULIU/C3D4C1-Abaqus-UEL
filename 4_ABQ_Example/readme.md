## Usage with Abaqus 

- This folder contains the Abaqus input files [mesh0.inp](mesh0.inp) and [mesh3.inp](mesh3.inp). 
- Abaqus input files can be generated by using a linear tet-mesh and replacing `*Element, type=C3D4` by
`
*USER ELEMENT,NODES=4,TYPE=U1003,PROPERTIES=1,COORDINATES=3,VARIABLES=1
1,2,3,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19
*ELEMENT,TYPE=U1003,ELSET=UELS
`
- Boundary conditions can be prescribed for the displacements (DOF 1 to 3) and the displacement gradient _H_ (DOF 4 to 12). Only the normal part of _H_ should be prescribed. It is possible to prescribe conflicting boundary conditions by prescribing _u_ and _H_. Then the displacement field will show oscillations on the element level.
- The simulations can be run with `abaqus job=mesh0 user=c3d4c1p56.f interactive cpus=1`.
- The usage of multiple CPUs may conflict with the output procedure as implemented in `c3d4c1p56.f`, some fine tuning is necessary here.
